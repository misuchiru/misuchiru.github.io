      <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
      <p>The App does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII).</p>

        <li>App usage and ad interaction data</li>
        <li>Approximate location (not GPS-level precision)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This data is processed by Google according to its own privacy policy. We do not have access to information that can identify you personally.</p>

      <h3>2. How We Use Information</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Delivering and optimizing advertisements</li>
        <li>Analyzing ad performance and app usage (via Google services)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The App does NOT:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Collect personal data</li>
        <li>Require account creation</li>
        <li>Sell, rent, or share your data with third parties (other than AdMob)</li>
        <li>Store any user information on our servers</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Third-Party Services</h3>
      <p>The App uses the following third-party service:</p>
      <strong>Google AdMob</strong>
      <p>Google may use cookies or similar technologies to serve personalized or non-personalized ads.<br>

      <h3>4. Children’s Privacy</h3>
      <p>The App is suitable for users of all ages (4+).</p>
      <p>We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 13. If you believe a child has provided personal information through Google’s ad services, please contact us and we will assist you as needed.</p>

      <h3>5. Data Security</h3>
      <p>We take privacy seriously. Because the App does not collect or store personal information, no sensitive data is retained on our systems.</p>

      <h3>6. Your Rights</h3>
      <p>Since the App does not collect any personal information, users do not need to request access, correction, or deletion of data.<br>
